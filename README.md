### What's GrooveTube?
GrooveTube is a video sharing application that answers the question that we've all inevitably had at some point: "What if YouTube was groovier?" With this searing question in mind I built GrooveTube, an application where users can watch and like videos, comment on them, and even upload their own. Check out GrooveTube at the link below.
